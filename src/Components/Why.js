            <p>I have seen from social media posts and the Sovtech website that the company culture and the ways in which teams collaborate are important 
                to your company. This is important to me as well because a good working environment and culture ultimately lead to greater productivity. From what 
                I can gather from my research about Sovtech, I will have no problem fitting in and adding value relative to my skillset. 
                The graduate programme prioritises growth while contributing to projects, as part of the programme is to learn new skills and improve 
                existing ones. This is important to someone like me who is only at the start of their software engineering journey. The mentoring offered in this position
                would be hugely beneficial to me, both in improving my skillset and adapting to a new environment. I would be very excited to work in a dynamic
                and growth minded workplace such as Sovtech.
